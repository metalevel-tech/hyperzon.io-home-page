The customer provided all the assets and the design of the site. Also almost finished frontend of the site, built with HTML5, CSS3 (Less), and third party JavaScript libraries and PHP. They asked me to finish and optimize the frontend of the site. They told me in the near future they will rebuild the site with the [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4) MVC framework. So In order to test all implemented features I was in need to build [a basic PHP MVC framework](https://github.com/metalevel-tech/php-simple-mvc-v1) for the current state of that project.
