                    This is a perfect example of a brand that advertise outside of Amazon, have spillover traffic, but don't utilise it. <b>The products had bad reviews, no organic ranks for their main keywords and all of the sales came from the spillover traffic.</b> We created a strategy for them to utilise the brand traffic in order to increase the rating of their products and after that started targeting their competitors and relevant keywords.<br /><br /> The result? <b>For 6 months the revenue increased by 300%, maintaining a healthy 20/80 distribution where only 20% are from brand searches and 80% are from relevant keywords and competitors.</b>
                    <br /><br />
                    Currently their best sellers are ranking on all the main keywords.

                    Precise keyword targeting and competitor ASIN targeting is crucial in scaling up ads. When we started working on this product the campaigns had almost no sales. This is a product that does not have any brand awareness or spillover brand traffic, just good reviews.
                    <br /><br />
                    We optimised the main image in order to increase the CTR, optimised the title and made an extensive research from where our competitors are getting their sales and started targeting them and those keywords. In addition to the sales from PPC, the product ranked on top positions on 90% of the keywords.
